Determine Pokemon type match-ups

24AUG - began work on pokemon move match-up

26AUG - finished rudimentary pokemon match-up where user selects move type and pokemon types individually

27AUG - implemented PokeAPI so user selects Pokemon and type is filled in

13SEP - uploaded defensive match-up where user selects a type combo and is told
what weaknesses that type combo has

14SEP - user can now select two Pokemon and see each one's weakness

TO-DO:
* have a "calculate all" button that tells you the total number of weaknesses in your team
* display an icon of the pokemon you select
* have an autocomplete feature to type in the pokemon's name
* DRY code significantly
* have a "move suggestion" that looks through list of moves pokemon can learn that would counter the weakness, and how the pokemon can learn the move
